# Mottling-eggshell-images
This repository is to share egg images collected for project on quality inspection of eggs based on eggshell quality on different mottling severity. 
> Project title: Classification of Inhomogeneous Eggshell Mottling Patterns using a Pretrained Convolutional Neural Network

The egg images are categorized into 4 groups:
1. Minor mottling (27)
2. Mottling with microcrack (11) 
3. Mottling with visible crack (33) 
4. Severe mottling (29)

Due to limited space, all egg images (1900 images) used for the project with different severity of mottling eggs are available upon reasonable request.
