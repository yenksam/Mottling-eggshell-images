# Mottling-eggshell-images
This repository is to share egg images collected for project on quality inspection of eggs based on eggshell quality on different mottling severity. 
> Project title: Classification of Inhomogeneous Eggshell Mottling Patterns using a Pretrained Convolutional Neural Network

The egg images are categorized into 4 groups:
1. Minor mottling (27)
2. Mottling with microcrack (11) 
3. Mottling with visible crack (33) 
4. Severe mottling (29)
