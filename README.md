# Mottling-eggshell-images
This repository is to share egg images collected for project on quality inspection of eggs based on eggshell quality on different mottling severity.
> Project title: Classification of Inhomogeneous Eggshell Mottling Patterns using a Pretrained Convolutional Neural Network
The work is publised and available at https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-electronic-imaging/volume-29/issue-1/013013/Classification-of-inhomogeneous-eggshell-mottling-patterns-using-a-pretrained-convolutional/10.1117/1.JEI.29.1.013013.short?SSO=1

The egg images are categorized into 4 groups:
1. Minor mottling (27)
2. Mottling with microcrack (11) 
3. Mottling with visible crack (33) 
4. Severe mottling (29)
